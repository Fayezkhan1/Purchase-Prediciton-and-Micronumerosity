# Purchase Prediction using Micronumerosity

This project aims to predict purchase behavior based on micronumerosity, which refers to the quantity or count of small units or objects. By analyzing a dataset of customer profiles and product characteristics, the project builds a machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of purchase for a given combination of customer and product, considering the concept of micronumerosity.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that helps in understanding purchase behavior based on micronumerosity. Micronumerosity takes into account the count, quantity, or number of small units or objects associated with a purchase decision. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a dataset of customer profiles and product features, the project provides insights into the likelihood of purchase for a given combination of customer and product, considering the influence of micronumerosity.

## Evaluation

The project's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the ROC curve (AUC). These metrics assess the prediction model's accuracy and ability to predict purchase behavior based on micronumerosity.
